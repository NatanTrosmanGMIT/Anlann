	<div class="text-white card-header">Fresh out of college Natan Trosman & Darragh Ryan have pooled together their skills, knowledge and funds to open Anlann (a dream they both shared and chased throughout their journey in college).
			<br>
			<br>
			Darragh having worked as a butcher for 9 years knew all about the handling of fresh meat and had made trustworthy contacts that could be used as suppliers of fresh Irish produce for their business. 
			Having a friend who is also a fantastic chef led to Darragh being able to hand pick the kitchen staff from highly recommended candidates.
			<br>
			<br>
			Natan having spent most of his life in Galway knew very well how successful businesses worked and lasted the test of time in Galway. 
			Over the years he too had made many associates in the Galway business world, this too has led to the successful opening of Anlann.
			<br>
			<br>
			It is down to all this that Anlann is as successful as it is today!
